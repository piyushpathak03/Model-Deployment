## What is Model serving?
When it comes to deploying ML models, data scientists have to make a choice based on their use case. If they need a high volume of predictions and latency is not an issue, they typically perform inference in batch, feeding the model with large amounts of data and writing the predictions into a table. If they need predictions at low latency, e.g. in response to a user action in an app, the best practice is to deploy ML models as REST endpoints. These apps allows to send requests to an endpoint thatâ€™s always up and receive the prediction immediately.
